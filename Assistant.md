# ZilMate Assistant — Architecture & New Updates 🌌

Welcome to the **ZilMate Assistant** handbook. This document describes the powerful advancements, architecture, and toolkits added across the **v1.10.x** release train (culminating in **v1.10.3**).

## 🚀 1. Pristine CLI Terminal Start-Up (v1.10.2)

We polished the terminal start-up sequence to offer a clean, premium visual aesthetic from the first second of execution.

*   **The Issue**: Standard `dotenv` (v17.4+) logs raw key injection counts and random tip banners (like `◇ injected env...` and `tip: ⌘ suppress logs`) to standard output when compiling and running. This leaked raw configuration info and cluttered the space above the beautiful ASCII welcome banner.
*   **The Solution**: Implemented a **Bulletproof Console Interceptor Wrapper** inside [src/config/env.ts](src/config/env.ts):
    ```typescript
    const originalLog = console.log;
    const originalError = console.error;
    console.log = () => {};
    console.error = () => {};
    try {
      // Load environment profiles safely...
    } finally {
      console.log = originalLog;
      console.error = originalError;
    }
    ```
    All environmental configurations still load correctly with local overrides taking precedence, but start-up output remains 100% clean and pristine.

## 🎨 2. Visual Swarm Trace Layout Tweaks (v1.10.2)

We overhauled the visual layout within the HTML trace reporting view inside [src/observability/traces.ts](src/observability/traces.ts) to enhance clarity, scalability, and usability:

*   **Fluid-Grid Scaling**: Removed rigid, legacy viewport limits (`h-full`, `lg:overflow-hidden`) on main tags, allowing trace timeline sections, Gantt chart columns, and pre-formatted text containers to scale dynamically with the screen height.
*   **Expanded Inspector Panels**: Stripped raw `max-h-60`, `max-h-52`, and `max-h-36` scrolling blocks from raw JSON inspect panels, collaboration reports, and wiki card text elements. This ensures large outputs render in full glory without nested, awkward multi-pane scrollbars.
*   **Aesthetic Alignment**: Styled scrolling structures to work as a natural single-scrolling canvas, optimizing the Gantt waterfall grid for large-screen monitoring and trace sharing.
*   **Elite Interactive Diagnostics**: Promoted interactive diagnostic capabilities including collapsible directory tree nodes with auto-expand query matching, clickable KPI metric cards acting as instant active trace filters, chronological Gantt chart timeline grid rulers with dotted tracking guides, and a single-click "Copy JSON" clipboard utility.

## 🏛️ 3. Decentralized Swarm (Digital Corporation Blueprint — v1.10.1)

We officially introduced a decentralized, multi-agent **Digital Corporation Blueprint** that organizes AI specialists into cooperative departmental layers:

### A. Departmental Topology
Over **30+ specialist agents** are organized into 6 core operational divisions:
*   **Strategy & Product**: Product Manager, UX Researcher, Market Analyst.
*   **Engineering & Creative**: Architect, Full-Stack Coder, QA Engineer, SRE, Video Producer, Security Auditors.
*   **Development Division**: Frontend/Backend Architects, DB Specialist, Auth/Billing Specialist, SRE, Data Intelligence, Mobile Coder.
*   **Growth & Marketing**: Growth Hacker, SEO Expert, Content/Ads/Social Managers, E-Comm Merchant, CRO, AI SEO Strategist.
*   **Operations & CS**: Customer Support, Legal Counsel, Logistics, HR, Finance Analyst.
*   **Data & Intelligence**: Data Scientist, BI Reporter, Agent Optimizer.

### B. Dual-Pillar P2P Coordination Fabric
Bypasses centralized supervisor bottlenecks to scale workflows and minimize latency:
1.  **Active P2P Bus (Joint War Room)**: Peers can directly trigger `collaborateWithPeer` to spawn dedicated ad-hoc channels to solve complex inter-departmental subtasks.
2.  **Passive Blackboard Bus (Semantic Corporate Wiki)**: Peers publish structured deliverables (facts, schemas, copy, code) into a shared semantic index (powered by **SuperMemory** and **Upstash Vector**) for others to consume asynchronously.

### C. Semantic Approvals Firewall (`approvals.ts`)
Intercepts all local host shell commands and filesystem write streams via high-performance string filters and real-time LLM guardrails to protect against prompt injection, file directory traversal, and OWASP exploits.

## 🧠 4. Swarm Memory Systems & Session Continuity (v1.10.1)

We designed a multi-tiered, durable memory ecosystem to guarantee context retention, cross-agent coordination, and crash/restart resilience:

### A. Session Continuity Engine (`session-continuity.tool.ts`)
*   **Persistent State Serialization**: Saves comprehensive, structural JSON handoffs (`handoff-[sessionId].json`) including progress summaries, subsequent task lists, and open execution threads to disk.
*   **Seamless Resumes**: Upon start-up or reboot, the system automatically pulls the latest state vector, allowing agents to instantly catch up without requiring the user to repeat instructions.

### B. Durable Private Notebook (`notebook.md` & `notes.json`)
*   Provides a structured workspace journal where the agents write down durable project constraints, system architecture decisions, configured ports, active CLI processes, and environmental patterns.
*   This acts as a secondary brain, isolated from short-term conversation context, that is indexed and queryable via keyword search.

### C. Joint War Room & Swarm Vector Blackboard
*   **SuperMemory & Upstash Vector** power a shared, semantic Corporate Wiki where any department agent can publish critical schemas, documentation, and interface specs, making them immediately accessible across the decentralized corporation.
*   **Local Thread Scratchpads**: Temporary thread planning journals (`scratchpad.tool.ts`) used within a single invocation, automatically discarded upon task completion to keep context windows pristine.

## 🛠️ 5. Extended Developer & SysOps Toolkits (v1.10.0)

We packed the core agent executable with native, high-performance tool integrations to handle real-world deployment challenges:

### ☁️ Cloud Storage Integration (S3 / GCS / Vercel Blob)
*   **Stream-Safe Uploads**: Employs tiered `@aws-sdk/client-s3` chunked streams, `@google-cloud/storage` SDK buffers, or `@vercel/blob` APIs to bypass memory limitations when uploading large database backups.
*   **Timed Pre-signed URLs**: Generates temporary file-sharing links directly.
*   **Fallback Architecture**: Automatically falls back to local command-line binaries (`aws`, `gsutil`, `vercel`) to utilize active SSO sessions if SDK credentials are not configured.

### 🐳 DevOps (Docker Control Suite)
*   Allows the agent to list running containers, fetch the last $N$ lines of stdout/stderr logs, and control container life cycles (start, stop, restart) to triage server issues locally.
*   Checks configuration parity by comparing active `.env` parameters against `.env.example` keys.

### 🔌 SysOps & Network Diagnostics
*   **Cross-Platform Port Profiler**: Identifies active listening TCP ports, resolving port numbers directly to host process names under Windows, macOS, and Linux.
*   **ICMP Diagnostics**: Runs low-level `pingHost` and `traceRoute` to profile gateway and database latency.
*   **Database Schema Analyzer**: Inspects SQLite database structures, tables, indexes, and schemas.

### 🎙️ Multimedia Engine (FFmpeg & STT/TTS)
*   Transcodes local video files (resizing, codec adjusting) and strips high-fidelity MP3 tracks using FFmpeg.
*   Features a **3-Tier Speech-to-Text & TTS Pipeline** falling back from high-performance Deepgram endpoints to Whisper APIs, and ultimately to native offline OS speech synthesizers in non-networked environments.

## ⚡ 7. Patch Release Polish (v1.10.3)

We implemented critical UX and cognitive optimizations to enhance interactive CLI stability, upgrade the background self-learning model, and align coding delegates with corporate wiki databases.

### 🔇 TTY Prompt Thinking Ticker Suppression
*   **The Issue**: The global `thinkingTimer` background spinner (operating at an 80ms interval) continued printing re-draw sequences while `readline` was awaiting user confirmations or multi-select inputs. This corrupted checkbox displays and caused line misalignment in standard terminals.
*   **The Solution**: Engineered `pauseThinkingTicker()` and `resumeThinkingTicker()` hooks inside [src/cli/format.ts](src/cli/format.ts) to gracefully pause background renders during active TTY prompts inside [src/cli/confirm.ts](src/cli/confirm.ts).

### 🔄 Dual-Pronged Performance Optimization Loop
*   **Offensive + Defensive Harvester**: Expanded the self-optimization compiler to capture both defensive guardrails (preventing compile-time and runtime failures) and offensive design accelerators (reusable patterns, prompt enhancements, and efficiency formulas).
*   **Semantic Deduplication**: Upgraded the optimizer in [src/observability/optimizer.ts](src/observability/optimizer.ts) to pre-query active rules from the Wiki, prompting the LLM to only output net-new rules or updates to existing ones (`isUpdateOfExisting: true`), preventing guideline bloat.

### 🧠 Semantic Corporate Wiki for Coding Subagents
*   **Aligning Coding Delegates**: Equipped the internal `appBuilder` and `qaIntegration` subagents inside [src/agents/coding.agent.ts](src/agents/coding.agent.ts) with full corporate wiki tools (`queryCorporateWiki` and `publishToCorporateWiki`).
*   **Unified Context Integration**: Subagents now fetch relational requirements, third-party schemas, and monetization guides dynamically before scaffolding code, guaranteeing architectural sync.
