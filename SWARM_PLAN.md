# ZilMate "Business Swarm" Implementation Plan

To transform ZilMate into a category-defining "Super Agent" capable of running an online business end-to-end, we will implement a **Hierarchical Swarm Architecture**.

## 1. Architecture: The Corporate Hierarchy

Instead of a flat list, we will organize agents into departments to prevent context bloat and improve reasoning.

*   **CEO Agent (The Manager):** High-level orchestration, goal setting, and inter-departmental delegation.
*   **Department Heads (Sub-Orchestrators):**
    *   **Engineering Lead:** Manages Coder, QA, and DevOps.
    *   **Growth Lead:** Manages Marketing, SEO, and Sales.
    *   **Operations Lead:** Manages Finance, Support, and Logistics.
*   **Specialists (Worker Agents):** 20+ focused agents with specific tool access.

## 2. The 20 Subagents
