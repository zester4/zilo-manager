## ⚡ Core Capabilities

### 1. Zero-Config Webhook Listener & Cloudflare Tunnel
ZilMate schedules background jobs via **Upstash QStash**. To receive public webhook notifications on your local system, the CLI features an automatic **Cloudflare Tunnel** downloader.
- Detects existing `cloudflared` globally on the system `PATH`.
- Automatically streams, verifies, and chmod-executes platform-specific binaries (`windows`, `macOS`, `linux`) into `~/.zilmate/bin/` if missing.
- Instantly binds local servers to a public proxy URL via `zilmate jobs listen --tunnel`.

### 2. Rich TTY Selection TUIs
For critical actions (e.g. system commands, writing files), ZilMate provides full user oversight:
- Generates beautiful framed cards utilizing custom console UI boundaries.
- Introduces scrollable **Multi-Select Safety Checklists** with toggleable checkboxes.
- Uses native keyboard capture (`Up/Down/Tab` to traverse, `Space` to toggle, `Enter` to approve) to filter and dispatch approved commands.

### 3. Pinned Status Cards
Maintains high visual feedback during long-running agent thinking steps. Redraws an animated loader with dynamic elapsed timers pinned safely at the bottom of the console while execution log lines scroll smoothly above it.

### 4. High-Fidelity PDF & Slides Generator
Allows specialized subagents to draft executive briefs:
- Generates styled corporate reports using hanging indents on lists.
- Outlines tables with stable, alternating row colors.
- Embeds boundary spacing checks to prevent word merging.
